It looks like you have a Kubernetes namespace named **"prob"** with a resource quota applied. Based on your `kubectl describe ns prob` output, the **resource quota** named `my-resource-quota` is limiting the number of pods to **10**, and currently, **1 pod is in use**.

### **What You Can Do Next**
1. **Check the Resource Quota Details**
   ```sh
   kubectl get resourcequota -n prob
   ```
   ```sh
   kubectl describe resourcequota my-resource-quota -n prob
   ```
   This will show the exact limits for different resources like CPU, memory, and pod count.

2. **Edit the Resource Quota (If Needed)**
   If you need to modify the quota (e.g., allow more pods), edit the `resource-quota.yaml` and apply the changes:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f resource-quota.yaml
   ```
   Or edit it directly:
   ```sh
   kubectl edit resourcequota my-resource-quota -n prob
   ```

3. **Check the Running Pods in the Namespace**
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n prob
   ```
   This will list all pods currently running in the **prob** namespace.

4. **Deploy a New Pod (If Needed)**
   If you want to create a pod inside this namespace, ensure it stays within the quota:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f samplepod.yml -n prob
   ```
